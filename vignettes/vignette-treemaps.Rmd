# - cannot use rmarkdown::html_vignette for the moment (maybe with R version 4.0)
# - use devtools::build_vignettes() to build the vignettes
# - need to build source package to have the vignettes

This panel shows a treemap both in terms of read numbers (left) and of number of ASVs (right).

Total read number per sample has been normalized to 100 with 3 decimals so that the value displayed in the different panels on the left size correspond to % of total eukaryotic reads.
