## Pipeline

* Raw fastq files were downloaded from NCBI or from author web site if not deposited to NCBI

* All datasets were processed with cutapdapt (Martin et al. 2011) to remove primers and the dada2 R package (Callahan et al. 2016) to compute ASVs.

* Samples with less than 1,000 reads after processing not considered.

* Assignment was done with dada2 assignTaxa using the 18S PR2 4.14.0 as reference

* ASVs with less 100 reads total and with bootstrap value at the supergroup level < 75 were not considered.

* Total read number per sample has been normalized to 100 with 3 decimals so that the value displayed in the different panels correspond to % of total eukaryotic reads. For this the number of reads for a given ASV in a given sample was divided by the total number of reads in this sample multiplied by 100.
