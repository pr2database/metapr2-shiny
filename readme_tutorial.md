# Going through the Shiny application

* RECORD

* Wait each time for the graph to refresh
* Restart if crash

## Data sets

Use the map with empty crosses

* OSD
* Tara
* Malaspina
  * Surface
  * Deep profiles

## Sample conditions

Use map

* Gene region
* DNA vs RNA (only for Malapsina vertical)
* Substrate - only water
* Size fractions
  * total (0.8-100) : OSD, Tara
  * pico (0.2- 3) : Malapsina
  
* Depth levels
  * surface (0-10 m) - Most OSD, Malaspina surface, Tara
  * euphotic (10-250 m) - A few OSD, Malaspina vertical
  * mesopelagic (250-1000 m) - Malaspina vertical

## ASV selection
  
* Minimum number of reads per ASV
  * 100 to 10000
  * Decrease the number of ASV and eliminate rate taxa
  * Faster if less ASV

## Taxonomy
Show with treemap

* Hierarchy


## Panels

### Treemap

* Show hierarchy
* Show effect of minimum number of ASVs when result in zero reads
  * Select more datasets
  * Select lower number of minimum ASVs
  
* Use examples
  * Chlorophyta
  * Excavata
  
### Map
* Information on top about number of samples with and without the taxa of interest
* Zooming in map and moving around
* Circle size
* Pie chart vs Dominant taxon
* Show information displayed for each point
* Show effect of increasing minimum number of ASVs (reducing %)

### Barplots
* Categorical vs Numeric variable
* Show one example for each variable

### Alpha diversity
* Categorical vs Numeric
* Different measures

### Beta diversity
* Be patient
* Samples vs Taxa (ASV)
* Show effect of changing taxonomy (Apicomplexa)
* Shape corresponds to discrete variables
* Color corresponds 

### Query
* Not used for this project
