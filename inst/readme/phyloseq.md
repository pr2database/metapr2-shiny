#### Phyloseq diversity analysis

Notes: 
* Maximum number of samples: **1000**
* Number of reads not rarefield or normalized. 
* For alpha diversity, smoothing is done with "gam" (general additive model). Samples with diversity of 0 are removed.
* If you increase the minimum number of reads an ASV must have (left menu) computation will be faster.

**BE PATIENT**, computation takes some time especially for beta diversity...
